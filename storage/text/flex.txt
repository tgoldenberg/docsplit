all the computers in your home. With enough capacity to support multiple computers and
users, you can easily store all of your files in one centralized location, while automatically and
continuously backing up the files and folders on every computer in your home.
Setup is as simple as connecting to your Wi-Fi router, and in just minutes, you can begin
wirelessly accessing files and streaming photos, music and movies to personal computers
(PCs), Mac® computers, and game consoles. Plus, you can share a printer with every
computer in the home by simply connecting it to the USB port on GoFlex Home.

application that allows you to access your files on GoFlex Home over the Internet, as well as

About Security

About Security
The Seagate Share feature provides remote access to your files and allows you to share your
content with friends and family outside of your home. Files and folders are private by default.
Your data is available only to those with whom you choose to share. Although your files are
forwarded to the recipients you choose when sharing, no copies from your GoFlex Home are
created or stored elsewhere. Your data remains safe and secure on your GoFlex Home
device.
All user name and password transmissions to/from the Seagate Share central server are
authenticated and forced through the secure HTTPS protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Secure).
If UPnP is enabled on your router, the data you choose to share transfers directly between
GoFlex Home device and the recipient’s Web browser or mobile device. If UPnP is not
enabled, sharing occurs through the Seagate Share central server and the recipient’s Web
browser or mobile device; however, none of your data or personal information is tracked or
stored by the central server during or after the process.
The GoFlex Home hardware and software are built to be secure against hacking and prevent
execution of macros or code from arbitrary third parties. You can increase the level of
security by enabling firewall and WEP/WPA protection on your router.
See http://support.goflexhome.hipserv.com/en/security/ for more information about security.

2. Setting Up GoFlex Home – Windows

Step 1: Familiarizing Yourself with the Setup Process

2. Setting Up GoFlex Home – Windows
Setting up GoFlex Home is easy. This chapter explains each step and provides suggestions
and options for getting the most out of GoFlex Home.

Step 1: Familiarizing Yourself with the Setup Process
Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the steps you’ll follow while setting up GoFlex
Home, and with the folders that GoFlex Home creates automatically for you during setup.

Main Setup Steps
•

Connect GoFlex Home (as described in the printed Quick Start Guide).

•

Name, activate, and register GoFlex Home.

•

Install the software on your own computer:
•

Seagate Dashboard, for access to all GoFlex Home features

•

Memeo Instant Backup, for automatic file backups

•

Create individual user accounts and passwords for everyone on your home network.

•

Install the software on the other Windows computers on your home network (or set up
Mac computers—see page 23).

See “Step 2: Connecting GoFlex Home” on page 13 for complete instructions.

Understanding GoFlex Home’s Automatic Folder Creation
When you create your own user account and password during setup, three folders are
automatically created on GoFlex Home for you:
•

A Public folder, where files can be stored and accessed by everyone on your home
network.

•

A Personal folder that only you can access, where you can store personal or private files
that you don’t want anyone else on your home network to see.

•

A Backup folder that only you can access, where all your backup files are stored.

GoFlex Home also automatically creates Personal and Backup folders for each user account
you create for the members of your household. Once setup is complete, each member of
your household can upload their own digital media and other files to GoFlex Home by
dragging and dropping files from their computers to the folders of their choice. For more
information, see “Copying Your Files to GoFlex Home” on page 44.

GoFlex Home Lights

If the GoFlex Home light is not solid green, wait about two minutes to make sure that GoFlex
Home has had a chance to fully start up; if it’s blinking amber, GoFlex Home either can’t
connect to the network or can’t communicate with the drive. See “Solving Problems” on
page 84 for more help.
If the drive light is not on, it means that the drive is not securely connected on the dock. Press
the Power button to the Off position, remove the drive, then re-seat it on the dock so that it
clicks into place.

Seagate Dashboard

The Seagate Dashboard is the central location from which you can access all of GoFlex
Home’s features. See page 35 for more information.
7. Continue setting up GoFlex Home for your household by adding user accounts for other
members of your household (see Step 5: Adding a User to GoFlex Home) and adding more
computers to your GoFlex Home network storage system (see "Step 6: Adding PCs to
GoFlex Home").

Step 5: Adding a User to GoFlex Home
Everyone who needs access to GoFlex Home requires their own user account. Your GoFlex
Home includes five user accounts.
TIP: You can upgrade to unlimited accounts (and add other useful GoFlex Home features)
by subscribing to Seagate Share Pro. See “About Seagate Share Pro” on page 10 for
more information.

2. Enter a user name.
User names must start with a letter and must be at least three characters in length. User
names are not case-sensitive. You can’t use the same user name twice on GoFlex Home.
3. Enter and confirm a password for the user.
Passwords must be at least six characters long and must include one number. Passwords are
case-sensitive.
TIP: When entering passwords, balance convenience and security appropriately for your
household. For instance, you might have the members of your household choose their
own passwords, but enter and keep track of them yourself so that you can act as the
home network manager in case a password is forgotten or another issue arises. Or,
you might have the members of your household enter their own passwords in private,
so that only they can access the files they store in their Personal and Backup folders.
4. Select Allow this user to create, modify, and delete user accounts if you want this person
to be able to do the same home network manager tasks as you.
5. Click Add User.
The user account is created, and the person can begin using GoFlex Home as soon as their
computer is added to your GoFlex Home network storage system (see page 21).

Step 1: Familiarizing Yourself with the Setup Process

3. Setting Up GoFlex Home – Mac
Setting up GoFlex Home is easy. This chapter explains each step and provides suggestions
and options for getting the most out of GoFlex Home.

Step 1: Familiarizing Yourself with the Setup Process
Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the steps you’ll follow while setting up GoFlex
Home, and with the folders that GoFlex Home creates automatically for you during setup.

Main Setup Steps
•

Connect GoFlex Home (as described in the printed Quick Start Guide).

•

Name, activate, and register GoFlex Home.

•

Install the desktop applications on your Mac:
•

GoFlex Home Agent

•

SmartFolderShortcut (which allows you to access your files through Finder)

•

SmartWebShortcut (which opens the Seagate Share application in your browser)

•

Configure Time Machine to use GoFlex Home as your file/system backup device.

•

Install the desktop applications and configure Time Machine on other Mac computers on
your home network (or set up Windows computers—see page 12).

See “Step 2: Connecting GoFlex Home” on page 13 for complete instructions.

Understanding GoFlex Home’s Automatic Folder Creation
When you create your own user account and password during setup, three folders are
automatically created on GoFlex Home for you:
•

A Public folder, where files can be stored and accessed by everyone on your home
network.

•

A Personal folder that only you can access, where you can store personal or private files
that you don’t want anyone else on your home network to see.

•

A Backup folder that only you can access, where all your backup files are stored.

GoFlex Home also automatically creates Personal and Backup folders for each user account
you create for the members of your household. Once setup is complete, each member of
your household can upload their own digital media and other files to GoFlex Home by
dragging and dropping files from their computers to the folders of their choice. For more
information, see “Copying Your Files to GoFlex Home” on page 44.

4. Getting Started with GoFlex Home
Now that GoFlex Home is set up, everyone in your household can begin sharing digital media
and other files, storing files on GoFlex Home and accessing them from anywhere on the
Internet, and backing up the files on their computers to GoFlex Home.
This chapter introduces the Seagate Dashboard and Seagate Share, the two applications
you use to access and manage GoFlex Home. It explains how to copy files from your
computer to your GoFlex Home folders, describes how to access your files when you’re
home or away from home, and provides getting-started tips for enjoying other popular GoFlex
Home features.

Opening the Seagate Dashboard
The Seagate Dashboard is the central location from which you can access all the features of
GoFlex Home. The Dashboard software is installed on Windows computers during setup.
Note:

The Seagate Dashboard is available on Windows computers only. Mac users must use
Seagate Share, the included Web-based application, to store, share, and access files on
GoFlex Home. (See “Opening Seagate Share” on page 38 for more information.) Windows
users can use either application.

You can open the Seagate Dashboard three ways:
•

Double-click the Seagate Dashboard icon on your desktop.

Logging In to the Seagate Dashboard
You log in to the Seagate Dashboard for the first time during setup (see page 12), and you
remain logged in even when you shut down your computer. You don’t need to log in each time
you open the Dashboard.
However, you can log in to the Dashboard from any computer that’s connected to GoFlex
Home, even if someone else is already logged in with their own account. By logging in as
yourself, you gain access to your own GoFlex Home folders.
Note:

Changing users on the Dashboard interrupts any file backup plan set up on the computer (see
page 46). If you have logged in to the Dashboard on someone else’s computer, allow them to
log in again as soon as possible for their current backup plan to continue uninterrupted.

To log in to the Dashboard when someone else is already logged in:
1. Open the Seagate Dashboard on the computer (see page 35).
2. Click Change next to the user name on the top right of the Dashboard.

Seagate Share is a Web-based application that lets you access GoFlex Home even when
you’re not on your home network. If you have an Internet connection and a computer, you
can use Seagate Share to watch movies, listen to music, view photos, or work with other files
stored on GoFlex Home from anywhere in the world. You can also share your files with
friends and family. (You can even access GoFlex Home from your smartphone or tablet. See
“Using GoFlex Access” on page 81 for more information.)
Seagate Share is not installed on your computer; it runs in your Web browser and provides
many of the same features as the Seagate Dashboard. In Seagate Share, you can copy files
from your computer to GoFlex Home, then access and work with them the same way you
would if they were on your computer. You can also add and change user accounts, manage
the GoFlex drive and any external USB drive connected to GoFlex Home, and change other
GoFlex Home settings.

Getting to Know Your GoFlex Home Folders
Every member of your household has access to three folders on GoFlex Home:
•

GoFlex Home Public: Folder where files can be shared with others on your home
network. Use the Public folder to create a household media library of digital music,
movies, videos, and photos (or other files) that everyone on your home network can
access from their own computer.

•

GoFlex Home Personal: Folder that only you can see and access, where you can store
personal or private files. You can access files stored in your Personal folder from any
computer or smartphone on the Internet, inside or outside your home, by logging in to
GoFlex Home with your user name and password.

•

GoFlex Home Backup: Folder that only you can see and access, where all your backup
files are stored. See “Backing Up Your Files to GoFlex Home” on page 46 for more
information.
When you open My Computer (Windows), open Finder or launch SmartFolderShortcut
(Mac), your GoFlex Home folders are listed as three separate drives. GoFlex Home
contains one Personal folder for every GoFlex Home user account; however, the only one
you see is the one that matches your user name and password.

Files on Your Home Network” on page 48 and “Accessing and Enjoying Your Files When
You’re Away from Home” on page 50.

Backing Up Your Files to GoFlex Home
Note:

The tasks described in this section can be done on Windows computers only.
Mac users—You can use Time Machine to back up your files to GoFlex Home. See “Step 5:
Configuring Time Machine for GoFlex Home” on page 31 to get started. Refer to the Time
Machine documentation on your computer for more information. If you don’t want to use Time
Machine backup software with GoFlex Home, you can use a complementary Mac version of
Memeo Instant Backup provided in a stand-alone folder on the GoFlex Home Installation CD.

Backup Performance
Depending on the amount of data you wish to back up, first-time backup of your computer to
GoFlex Home could take a significant amount of time if done wirelessly. It is recommended
that you connect an Ethernet cable from your computer directly to your router for the initial
backup.

Backing Up Your Files to GoFlex Home

Transfer speeds are much greater if you connect your computer to a Gigabit Ethernet router
or switch compared to a wireless connection. Once complete, all subsequent backups can
occur wirelessly.

About Memeo Instant Backup
GoFlex Home includes Memeo Instant Backup software, a simple way to ensure your files
are protected in case your computer is damaged, lost, or stolen. Once you start backups for
your computer, Memeo Instant Backup automatically and continuously backs up every
important file on your computer without any input from you.
GoFlex Home includes access to Memeo Instant Backup for up to three computers.

Starting Automatic Backups
To start automatic backups of your computer:
1. Open the Seagate Dashboard (see page 35).
Note:

Install the latest version of Memeo Backup if you are prompted to update the software. This
ensures that GoFlex Home has the latest features.

2. Click Instant Backup.
Memeo Instant Backup opens.
Memeo Instant Backup automatically scans your computer’s C drive and shows which files
and folders will be backed up. You can change what will be backed up by clicking Advanced
Options.
3. Ensure that your GoFlex Home Backup folder is selected from the drop-down menu.
4. Click Start Backup.
Memeo Instant Backup backs up your files. This may take some time, depending on how
many files you have. If necessary, you can pause and restart the backup.
For additional information, refer to the Memeo Instant Backup Help. For more information
about Memeo Instant Backup, click ? on the Seagate Dashboard to open the online Help.

Continuous Backups
From now on, any new file you add to your computer, and any existing file that you edit and
save, is backed up automatically by Memeo Instant Backup. You don’t have to take any
additional steps to ensure your files are protected.
TIP: If you’re an advanced user, upgrade to Memeo Premium Backup for more features,
options, and flexibility. Click Learn More under Premium Backup in the Seagate
Dashboard Application Store.

folders the same way you would if they were stored directly on your computer.

Accessing and Enjoying Your Files When You’re Away
from Home
You can access your three GoFlex Home folders from anywhere in the world over the
Internet. Whether you’re on your computer, smartphone, or other device, you have to use
Seagate Share to access your files remotely.
You can watch movies, listen to music, view photos, and open other files in the GoFlex Home
Personal and Public folders the same way you would if they were stored directly on your
computer. You can also edit, save, or delete files stored on GoFlex Home.
To access your files remotely, follow the instructions in “Accessing Your Files From Seagate
Share” on page 49.
See “About Security” on page 11 for information about the security methods used when
accessing your files remotely and when sharing your files with others.

Sharing Your Files with Friends and Family
Once you have copied files to GoFlex Home, you can compile collections of music, movies,
photos, and other documents to enjoy yourself or share with friends and family. (Seagate
Share Pro subscribers can also share photos on Facebook and Flickr, and by RSS—Really
Simple Syndication—feeds.)
This section explains how to compile collections of files into shares, which are similar to
folders, and make them available to others over the Internet.

Creating a Share
A share is a collection of related music, movies, photos, and documents that you assemble
yourself from your GoFlex Home folders. A share doesn’t contain copies of your files, just
references to files, so it takes up very little room on GoFlex Home. (If you delete a file from its
folder, change the name of the file or folder it’s in, or move the file or folder, the file
disappears from any share in which it’s included.)
To create a share:
1. Open Seagate Share and log in (see page 38).
2. Click Seagate Share.
The Seagate Share window opens.
3. In the Shares panel, click the plus sign (+).
The Create Share window opens.

Sharing Your Files with Friends and Family

4. Enter a name and a description for the share, then select a theme, which adds a background
image to the share.
5. Click inside the Share with box:
•

Enter at least one e-mail address, or click Address Book to add e-mail addresses from
your address book.

•

Click Create to create the share and send an e-mail to your recipients, or click More
Sharing Options to specify sharing options as follows:
•

Click Family Accounts to make your share available to everyone on your home
network who can access your GoFlex Home.

•

Click Friends to make your share available to specific people outside your home
network. Click Share until and then set a share-until date and add password
protection to your share, if you want. Shares are read only. Your friends are not
restricted from forwarding the e-mail, so keep this in mind when choosing with whom
you share.

Note:

The first time you invite friends to view a share, Seagate Share prompts you for your e-mail
address, which is used as the return address on the invitation sent by Seagate Share. You
can change your e-mail address later, if you want (see page 70). If you choose to add
password protection to your share, the people you invite to view it are prompted to create
a password before they can view the share. (See “Setting Up and Managing an E-mail
Address Book for Shares” on page 68 for more information.)

•

Click Everyone to make your share available (and searchable) on the Internet and
through RSS feeds, then set a share-until date, if you want.

•

Click Media Devices to make your share available to the digital media devices on
your home network (see page 55).

6. By default, Allow Downloads is enabled, which lets others download the original, fullresolution version of all the files in the share. This is particularly useful for shares that include
documents you want to share with others, because the share itself contains only a references
to files, not copies of the files themselves.
7. Click Create.
The share is created.
8. To add content to your share, in the Content panel, select the folder you want then drag and
drop either the entire folder or selected files into the share.

address. See “Customizing Your GoFlex Home User Settings” on page 70 to learn how to set
your GoFlex Home e-mail address.

Web content (like news sites and blogs) to a large number of people. You can subscribe to an
RSS feed to stay up-to-date on your favorite sites.
With GoFlex Home, others can subscribe to an RSS feed to stay up-to-date on the content of
your shares, if you make them available to everyone (see Step 5 on page 51). Only photos
and other images appear in the RSS feed; music, movie, and document files are not
included.
If your share is available to everyone, an RSS icon automatically appears in the share
toolbar. If someone viewing the share clicks its RSS icon, the share opens in an RSS reader,
which shows the name and description of the share, and shows its images sorted by name.

Managing Files and Folders

TIP: If you move a file to another folder, it will no longer be available in any existing share.

Copying a File
When you copy a file, the original stays where it is and you place a second version in another
location. Copying a file duplicates the original full-resolution version stored in the folder, not
the compressed version that appears in Seagate Share. Nothing is removed from the original
location. Remember that each copy of a file takes up the same amount of storage space on
your GoFlex Home.
To copy a file, use the file menu (see page 42) to Copy and Paste it to a new location.

Renaming a File
You can rename any file that’s within a folder, if necessary.
TIP: If you rename a file, it will no longer be available in any existing share.
To rename a folder:
1. Move your mouse over the file you want, click the arrow that appears, then click Rename.
The Rename File window opens.
2. Enter a new name, then click Rename.
The file is renamed.

Adding Captions and Tags to Your Files
A file’s caption is a description of the file, and it appears whenever you view a file within a
folder or a share. (Seagate Share Pro subscribers—Photo captions also appear when you
share your photos through Facebook, Flickr, or RSS feeds.) You can use caption text to
search for a file.
A file’s tags store additional information about a file. Tags appear in the Details panel of the
Seagate Share page when you view a file within a folder. Tags don’t appear in shares, or when
you post your photos on Facebook, Flickr, or by RSS feed. You can use tags to search for a file.
If you tag files consistently, you will be able to find the files you’re looking for more easily,
especially as their numbers grow over time.
To add a caption and/or tags to a file:
1. On The Seagate Share page, navigate to the folder that contains the file you want.
2. Move your mouse over the file you want, click the arrow that appears, then click View
Details.
A Details panel opens on the Seagate Share page.
3. Enter a caption in the Caption box.

remove files from it, rename it, and manage the access settings to limit or expand who can
view it. You can also delete an entire share.
TIP: Keep in mind that files appear in shares by reference only—your original files remain
in their original locations inside your GoFlex Home folders. If you move, delete, or
rename a file or its folder, any share that references that file won’t be able to access it
anymore. However, deleting a share does not delete the files it contains.

When you create a share and you or others view it, the share streams compressed images to
conserve bandwidth and improve performance. You can configure a share to allow those
viewing it to download original full-resolution versions of the files.
Allowing downloads is especially important if the share contains documents, because the
share references these files but cannot open them. (To allow downloads from a share, see
Step 6 of “Creating a Share” on page 50.)

•

Notifications: Sets the e-mail address(es) to be used for occasional system messages.
The e-mail addresses entered in this field receive a system message only if there is a
problem with the drive, if the drive is full, or if your Seagate Share Pro subscription is
expiring soon.

•

Network Services: Controls whether or not your GoFlex Home can be accessed from an
FTP site. For improved security, disable FTP access unless or until you specifically
require it. Enabling FTP means that members of your household can use it to upload and
download files to their GoFlex Home folders with FTP.
You can limit FTP access to computers on your home network (LAN) only, or enable FTP
access from anywhere on the Internet.

•

LAN Connection: Controls whether or not GoFlex Home connects to your home network
using settings it obtains automatically. (Unless you have networking experience, have
business-grade network equipment at home, or are experiencing problems when
accessing GoFlex Home while you’re travelling, you should set Obtain IP Address
Automatically to Yes. No other input is required.)
If you need to manually set up a LAN connection for GoFlex Home, set Obtain IP Address
Automatically to No, then enter all the required information in the fields that appear:
•

Server IP Address: Sets the static IP address for GoFlex Home. Obtain the static IP
address from your ISP (Internet service provider), and use it to replace the dynamic IP
address that appears in the box by default.

•

Server Netmask: Sets the subnet mask, which determines the address range of the
subnet, a separate part of your network. Data sent to addresses within the subnet (for
example, between your computer and GoFlex Home) are routed within the network.
Data sent to addresses outside the subnet (for example, between a remote user and
GoFlex Home) are routed to the Internet. Most home networks with less than 255
nodes use netmask.24.

•

Gateway: Sets the IP address of the device (most likely your router) that routes data
from GoFlex Home to the Internet.

•

Date and Time: Controls the date and time used by GoFlex Home. You can set GoFlex
Home to obtain its settings from the Internet using an Internet time server, or you can set
GoFlex Home’s date and time yourself. If you set Set date and time from the Internet to
Yes, select a default NTP (Network Time Protocol) server for best results.

•

Remote Access: When enabled, allows GoFlex Home to be accessed from anywhere
over the Internet. You can use this setting to disable remote access, which is enabled
automatically when you set up GoFlex Home.

Mac during setup) to use Time Machine to back up files on your computer to GoFlex
Home. Before configuring the backup utility on your computer, you must enable
ComputersBackup and create a password. The password will be required when you
configure the backup facility on your computer.
You can also delete all backed up data from GoFlex Home by clicking Wipe.
Caution: Wiping backups deletes ALL backed up data for ALL GoFlex Home users (not just
your own backup files).

•

Storage Devices: Lets you safely remove a USB drive from GoFlex Home (see page 76).
Also lets you format a USB drive to change it to a NTFS (New Technology File System)
format for Windows.
Caution: Formatting a USB drive deletes all existing files from the drive.

About GoFlex Access

7. Using GoFlex Access
The GoFlex Access™ app allows you to stream content from your GoFlex Home to a
smartphone or tablet running the iOS or Android operating system.

About GoFlex Access
The GoFlex Access app lets you remotely access all the photos, movies, music and
documents stored on your GoFlex Home network storage system. Simply launch the app and
log in to access your files and shares from anywhere when connected to Wi-Fi or 3G/4G.
Using GoFlex Access, you can:
•

Access your files stored at home from anywhere you have a Wi-Fi or 3G/4G connection

•

View your stored photos from your smartphone or tablet

•

Create photo slideshows with background music

•

Share your documents

•

Stream videos and music (including cover art)

Note:

GoFlex Access is a streaming app only; it does not support uploading or downloading of
content between the GoFlex Home and your mobile device.

Installing GoFlex Access on Your Device
To use the GoFlex Access app for smartphones and tablets, the devices require:
•

Apple® iOS 4.3 or higher

•

Android™ 2.2 or higher

On Android devices, the Adobe® AIR® app must be installed.
1. Open the app store or marketplace for your device and then search for “seagate”.
2. Install the remote access app on your device.
Note:

If the GoFlex Access app is not found in the app store for your device, it’s not yet available for
your model of device.

Connecting to GoFlex Home from Your Device
1. Once the GoFlex Access app is installed, open the app on your device.

7. Using GoFlex Access

Playing Video

2. Enter the name you gave your GoFlex Home during setup.
3. Enter the user name and password you use to log in to your GoFlex Home.

Playing Video
The GoFlex Access app can stream video in the following formats:
•

H.264 video, up to 1.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second; low-complexity
version of the H.264 baseline profile; AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio;
.m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats.

•

H.264 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second; baseline profile up
to level 3.0; AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio; .m4v, .mp4, and .mov
file formats.

•

MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second; simple profile;
AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio; m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats.

Note:

The GoFlex Access app is unable to stream video that is not in one of the formats listed
above. If you have video in .mkv, .avi, .wmv, .3gp, .vob, .m2ts, or other non-supported video
format, and would like to stream it using the GoFlex Access app, you can manually transcode
it into one of the supported formats. There are many video transcoding software options
available, some of which are free, that you can use to change your video files into one of the
supported formats.

If the video appears to be stuttering upon playback, try rebooting your smartphone or tablet.
This can free up memory and system resources. Also check the upload speed of the GoFlex
Home, or the download speed of your smartphone or tablet, since high network traffic or low
download speed can be the cause of stuttering video. If you are using a 3G connection, try
switching the connection to Wi-Fi if possible.

Playing Music
The GoFlex Access app can stream music files in .mp3 format. Using the Android version of
the app, you can start streaming music and keep playing it in the background while you run
other apps or play a picture slideshow.

Viewing Pictures
GoFlex Access lets you view pictures stored on your GoFlex Home from your smartphone or
tablet. You can scroll through your pictures one at a time, or view them in a picture slideshow.
To start a picture slideshow, open a picture, and press the Play button in the top right corner.
GoFlex Access cycles through your stored pictures, displaying a new picture every five

seconds. To play music during a picture slideshow, start playing the music first, then browse
to your pictures and start a slideshow.

Playing Protected Content from iTunes
Video purchased from the iTunes store contains Digital Rights Managment (DRM) protection
and can only be played on iOS devices authorized to play it. To play this kind of video, your
iOS device must be authorized to the account that purchased the video, and must have been
synched to iTunes since the purchase was made.
Most music purchased from the iTunes store does not contain DRM protection, and can be
played without restrictions. For DRM-protected music files purchased from the iTunes store,
you can use GoFlex Access to play them on your iOS device after the files have been
synched to the iOS device.
DRM-protected files purchased from the iTunes store cannot be played with the Android
version of the GoFlex Access app.

8. Solving Problems

Common Problems and Solutions

8. Solving Problems
GoFlex Home is a plug and play device. However, in certain situations, the setup process
may require extra attention. Below is a list of troubleshooting tips to assist you should you
have any problems during setup.
•

Ensure that the supplied power adapter is securely connected to GoFlex Home and to a
power source. If you are using a power strip, make sure it is turned on.

•

Check that one end of your network cable is securely connected to the Ethernet port on
GoFlex Home and the other end is connected to a functioning port on your network
router.
If the network cable is securely connected and the light is amber, the network cable or the
Ethernet port may not be functioning properly. To test this, connect the network cable to a
different port on your router. If there is still no connection, try a different Ethernet cable.
Make sure your router is turned on.

•

Ensure that your router gives out IP addresses to computers on your network (DHCP)
and that DHCP is enabled on your router. DHCP is usually enabled on home networks. If
it is not, you will have trouble connecting to GoFlex Home. If you need assistance
enabling DHCP on your router, see your router documentation.

•

Ensure that your home network isn’t down or disabled, and that your Internet service isn’t
disrupted.

Common Problems and Solutions
This section provides suggestions for solving common problems.

Why can’t I create a new user account?
You may have exceeded the number of user accounts allowed. GoFlex Home includes five
user accounts, including the home network manager who set up GoFlex Home initially. To
create a new user account, you must either delete an existing account (if someone has left
the household, for instance) or upgrade to unlimited user accounts by subscribing to Seagate
Share Pro. See page 10 for more information.

Why won’t my computer connect to GoFlex Home?
If you have installed the GoFlex Home software on your computer but it won’t connect to
GoFlex Home, check that your home network is working properly and that the GoFlex Home
device is properly connected and powered on. Make sure that the supplied Ethernet cable is
connected from GoFlex Home to your router.
If other computers are successfully connected to GoFlex Home, you may have exceeded the
number of computers allowed. GoFlex Home includes licenses for five computers. To add
another computer, you must either delete an existing user account (which disconnects their

84

8. Solving Problems

Common Problems and Solutions

computer) or upgrade to unlimited user accounts by subscribing to Seagate Share Pro. See
page 10 for more information.
Some virus protection and firewall software block network traffic for security purposes. If you
have such software running on your network, check to see if either may be blocking
communication. Create firewall exceptions for the GoFlex Home services if necessary. If you
need to add firewall exceptions, the GoFlex Home services are: memeo.exe, hipserv.exe,
and dashboard.exe.

Why can’t I use the name I want for GoFlex Home/my user account?
The GoFlex Home device itself must have a name that’s completely unique—unused by any
other device in the world. You may have to slightly adjust the name you want to make it
unique, in the same way you often have to try a few times to find an online user name or email address that’s not already in use. Use the Check Availability button for help.
Additionally, your GoFlex Home name must start with a letter and must be at least three
characters in length. You can use letters, numbers, dashes, dots, and underscores. Spaces
are not allowed.
Within your GoFlex Home network storage system, no two user accounts can have the same
name, even if they have different computers and different passwords.

Why won’t Memeo Instant Backup let me back up more than three computers
to GoFlex Home?
GoFlex Home includes access to Memeo Instant Backup for up to three computers. To add
more computers, upgrade to Memeo Premium Backup. For more information, click Learn
More under Premium Backup in the Seagate Dashboard Application Store.

I’m the home network manager and I can’t remember my GoFlex Home
password. How do I reset it?
If you are the home network manager (the person who set up GoFlex Home originally) and
you can no longer remember your GoFlex Home password, follow these instructions to reset
your password:
1. Make sure that no one is accessing GoFlex Home. No one should be viewing photos,
watching a movie, listening to music, or working with any other file stored on GoFlex Home,
or copying files to or from their GoFlex Home folders.
2. Using a paperclip, press and hold the Reset button for three (3) seconds. The reset button is
located on the side of the GoFlex Home dock, as shown in Figure 1 on page 8.
Caution: Don’t hold the Reset button longer than 5 seconds. Holding down the Reset button for
10 seconds erases all your custom GoFlex Home settings (see page 77).

The white drive light blinks to show that GoFlex Home is shutting down. When shutdown is
complete, both lights turn off.
3. Press the Power button to restart GoFlex Home if the device doesn’t restart on its own.

4. On your computer, open a Web browser (such as Explorer or Safari) and enter the GoFlex
Home IP address in this format:
http://GoFlexHomeIPaddress/
For example:
http://192.168.0.12/
To find the IP address of GoFlex Home on a computer running the Windows operating system,
find GoFlex Home in the list of Network devices and check its Properties. (In Windows XP, if
GoFlex Home doesn’t appear in the network device list, click Show icons for networked
UPnP devices in My Network Places, then follow the on-screen instructions.)
To find the IP address of GoFlex Home on a computer running the Mac operating system,
use the Network Utility in Finder (Applications > Utilities).

Why does GoFlex Home seem to shut down by itself?
GoFlex Home includes a power-save feature, which means that GoFlex Home enters a
standby state after 12 minutes of no activity. GoFlex Home automatically returns to active
mode whenever someone on your network storage system accesses their folders and files.

During setup, someone else logged into the Seagate Dashboard. What can I
do?
The Seagate Dashboard allows you to change users. See “Logging In to the Seagate
Dashboard” on page 37 for more information.
Alternatively, open Seagate Share (see page 38), click Sign Out, then log back in as
yourself.

Why can’t my media player detect GoFlex Home?
Your media player must support one of these connection technologies:
•

UPnP-AV (Universal Plug-and-Play Audio and Video)

•

DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance)

•

Windows Media Connect

If you have a large amount of files stored on GoFlex Home, it will take awhile for the files to
be indexed and viewable from your media player. If your media device cannot detect GoFlex
Home, try these troubleshooting tips:
•

Before your media player can discover and play the digital media files on your GoFlex
Home, you have to make them available by selecting Share with Media Devices from
Seagate Share. See “Enjoying Your Files on a Digital Media Player or Game Console” on
page 55 for instructions.

•

Ensure that UPnP is enabled on your router. See your router documentation for
instructions on enabling UPnP if it is disabled. You can also view

configuration tool.

Why is the GoFlex Home indicator light amber?
If GoFlex Home is connected to a power source and to a router but the top light on the front is
not solid green, try these troubleshooting tips:
•

Ensure that the supplied power adapter is securely connected to GoFlex Home and to a
power source. If you are using a power strip, make sure it is turned on.

•

Check that one end of your network cable is securely connected to the Ethernet port on
GoFlex Home and the other end is connected to a functioning port on your network
router.
If the network cable is securely connected and the top light on the front of your GoFlex
Home is amber, the network cable or the Ethernet port may not be functioning properly. To
test this, connect the network cable to a different port on your router. If there is still no
connection, try a different Ethernet cable or a different network.

•

Make sure your router is turned on.

•

Ensure that your router gives out IP addresses to computers on your network (DHCP)
and that DHCP is enabled on your router. DHCP is usually enabled on home networks. If
it is not, you will have trouble connecting to GoFlex Home. If you need assistance
enabling DHCP on your router, see your router documentation.

•

Some virus protection and firewall software block network traffic for security purposes. If
you have such software running on your network, check to see if either may be blocking
communication.
Create firewall exceptions for the GoFlex Home services if necessary. If you need to add
firewall exceptions, the GoFlex Home services are: memeo.exe, hipserv.exe, and
dashboard.exe.

Ensure that UPnP is enabled on your router. See your router documentation for instructions
on enabling UPnP if it is disabled. You can also view www.support.goflexhome.hipserv.com
for additional troubleshooting help, including a guided router configuration tool.
•

Ensure that your router is not blocking UDP traffic. If so, you may need to open a port on
your router. See your router documentation for instructions.

•

Turn off GoFlex Home by pressing the Power button and then turn it back on again.

•

Confirm that your Internet connection is working properly. Open a Web browser on your
computer and then access a favorite Web site.

If the top light on the front is still amber, this means that there is an issue with the Internet
connection or GoFlex Home is not communicating with the service.

•

Ensure that the drive is properly and fully connected to the dock.

•

Ensure that your home network isn’t down or disabled. (Look at the lights on the back of
the GoFlex Home dock—if they’re not on and blinking, GoFlex Home is not connected to
your network.)

•

Ensure that the Ethernet cable connecting GoFlex Home to your router isn’t damaged.

•

Ensure that your Internet connection isn’t down or disabled. (Open a browser on your
computer to check.)
